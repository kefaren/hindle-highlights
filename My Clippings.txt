Each step in the development of the bourgeoisie was accompanied by a corresponding political advance of that class. An oppressed class under the sway of the feudal nobility, an armed and self-governing association in the medieval commune:4 here independent urban republic (as in Italy and Germany); there taxable “third estate” of the monarchy (as in France); afterwards, in the period of manufacturing proper, serving either the semi-feudal or the absolute monarchy as a counterpoise against the nobility, and, in fact, cornerstone of the great monarchies in general, the bourgeoisie has at last, since the establishment of Modern Industry and of the world market, conquered for itself, in the modern representative State, exclusive political sway. The executive of the modern state is but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie.

Long-term exposure to noise has been shown to increase the risk of heart disease and stroke, largely because it increases blood pressure and creates stress. This is not restricted to industrial-scale noise: with group work in class, teachers are regularly exposed to enough noise to activate this effect. It is probable that many teachers are shortening their lives by working in noisy classrooms day after day. Noise also results in massive global health issues by causing sleep deprivation. The World Health Organisation estimates that around 8 million people in Western Europe are suffering nightly sleep interruptions due to traffic noise that’s way above its recommended maximum level; many more are affected in the same way by nearby airports or railways. Long-term sleep deprivation has many serious health effects, from stress and depression to impaired immune systems; it also leads to accidents, impatience, irritability and violence. This problem has not been quantified in other territories, but I have no doubt that it

This is a crucial point, and one that is increasingly threatened in the world we are creating. Post-truth politics, fake news, selective web browsing that only confirms our preconceptions, attack journalism that constantly interrupts or mingles opinion with fact, sound bites, personal broadcasting on social media platforms, 140-character diplomacy… these are all undermining the quality of our listening and eroding our ability to coexist in peace even when we disagree.

For many millennia, stories have been among the most powerful tools in the essential task of passing knowledge and history on from one generation to the next, or from one group to another. Writing has been available only for around 5 thousand years, so from the development of complex language (estimated at up to 100,000 years ago) all human knowledge was spread simply by speaking and listening. Throughout those many years, countless groups of humans have sat around fires at night listening with wonder and rapt attention to a local sage or storyteller pass on tales that carried wisdom from the past. In some societies, this powerful oral tradition still exists. Indian classical music has no written form at all:

This is a tough one. Take on the challenge of saying exactly what you mean and no more – no hyperbole, which means cutting out the intensifiers like ‘really’, ‘very’, ‘super’ unless they are genuinely required, and right-sizing your adjectives. You may want to give yourself a short time limit on this at first, maybe an hour or at most a day. It’s a challenging discipline, but its benefit is a degree of recalibration: you may find you have more capacity to express strong feelings by giving back the strength to extreme words.
